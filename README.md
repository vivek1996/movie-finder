A simple site giving the movies info using Jquery Ajax function .
Information is from the [Omdb Api](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

# Problem Statement -
Check out the following open API url - http://www.omdbapi.com/
As a solution to this problem, you are supposed to create an application that enables
user to search movie titles using various parameters - By Imdb Id or title or year.
It should have only one view containing a search screen which enables users to provide
these inputs. You have to write Jquery code to change the requests according to
options selected by user and show the response received(search results) by the API in
form of cards containing all the information available in the response. If you receive a
poster image, you have to display that as well and if its not available, it should display a
dummy picture.
You may refer the API documentation given on the page for your references and take
help from them as well. As instructed on this page, you have to generate a free API key
to use this API.
